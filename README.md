# Challenge-5-Work-Day-Scheduler
Work day scheduler built with dynamic HTML, CSS, and new skills learned from jquery and bootstrap. 

## Description
This project was designed to build a day to day event calendar that is color coded, pulling times from moment js, and color coded to indicate when it is the present, past, or future. 

This project was especially challenging for me because I had written all my code out that I thought would work, but my dynamically created elements simply would not load onto my server. I had spent hours trying to figure out how to debug and adjust my code and nothing was working. It was especially discouraging because it seemed like I had my logic in place correctly so my code SHOULd have worked, but I just didn't know how to properly debug. It wasn't until I had a tutoring session with a more experienced coder giving me some tips that I finally had everything working the way I wanted it to. I'm super proud of all the effort I put in, and I'm very proud to be able to finally turn in this project.
